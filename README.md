# CS-350-Portfolio

What problem did the projects solve?
These projects tackled the challenge of building embedded systems that interact with real-world hardware using software logic. The Morse code system demonstrated real-time input/output communication, while the thermostat addressed environmental monitoring and device control—both of which are critical for IoT and smart device applications.

What did I do particularly well?
I excelled in designing and implementing clear, logical state machines to manage device behaviors and user interactions. I also ensured stable and synchronous hardware communication using GPIO and UART, and wrote modular, well-commented Python code that made troubleshooting efficient.

Where could I improve?
I could further improve my hardware debugging process. In early stages of the thermostat project, I faced challenges with the LCD interface and sensor integration due to incorrect pin mappings and timing mismatches. I’ve learned to consult datasheets and wiring schematics more carefully in future builds.

What tools and resources am I adding to my support network?
I’ve added technical documentation platforms like Adafruit and SparkFun to my go-to resources. I also started using GitHub Discussions and Stack Overflow more actively for real-time problem solving. Additionally, I am incorporating hardware simulation tools like Fritzing to visualize circuits before implementing them physically.

What skills from this project are transferable?
Key transferable skills include:

Embedded Python scripting

Serial communication protocols (UART)

Hardware interface design with GPIO and sensors

State machine logic and modular code structuring

Troubleshooting and debugging embedded systems

How did I make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I structured the code using functions and classes where appropriate to promote reuse and clarity. All variables were named descriptively, and I included inline comments and a dedicated documentation block at the top of each script. I also separated hardware-specific code from logic flow to ensure portability between devices or future upgrades.
